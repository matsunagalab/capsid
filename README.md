# Files used in "Explicit description of viral capsid subunit shapes by expanding dihedrons" by Toyooka et al.

- [docking_axes_viper/](https://github.com/matsunagalab/capsid/tree/main/docking_axes_viper) contains notebooks for aligning the subunit coordinates with viber coordinate system (Z-axis is the 2-fold axis, 3-fold axis is on the X-axis, and 5-fold axis is on the Y-axis)

- [docking_pairwise/](https://github.com/matsunagalab/capsid/tree/main/docking_pairwise) contains input scipts and analysis notebooks for pairwise docking simulations for subunits
